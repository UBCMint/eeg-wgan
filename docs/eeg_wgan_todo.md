# EEG WGAN
Implement synthetic generation of EEG data using WGAN from MINT. See main README.md for more info.

### TODO
- [ ] Understand what the WGAN code does.
  - [ ] What is the input? Output?
  - [ ] Do I need to train a new model? Or can I use an existing one?
  - [ ] How fast does it work? Can I make it faster?
  - [ ] Divide the remaining Jupyter Notebook sections into multiple python files.
- [ ] Write skeleton code for EEG WGAN
  - [ ] Function to be called for generating a single window of synthetic data
  - [ ] Function to be called for generating the window of data for as long as we need
